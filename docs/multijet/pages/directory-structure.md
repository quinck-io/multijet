# Directory structure

After creating a project this is the directory structure generated by the Multijet CLI:

```
my-project/
├── configs/
├── deploy/
│ ├── aws/
│ └── docker/
├── libs/
├── microservices/
├── package.json
├── tsconfigs.base.json
└── turbo.json
```

## Configs

This folder contains all the common and global configuration files:

-   esbuild configuration
-   OpenAPI definition file

## Deploy

The deploy directory contains all the necessary configurations and scripts needed to deploy the project. As of now there are two deplaoy methods supported by Multijet:

-   AWS Lambda
-   Docker

Inside the /aws folder is located the SAM template needed to deploy or run locally the project with AWS Lambda.

## Libs and Microservices

To learn more about libs and microservices head to the [Workspaces section]().
